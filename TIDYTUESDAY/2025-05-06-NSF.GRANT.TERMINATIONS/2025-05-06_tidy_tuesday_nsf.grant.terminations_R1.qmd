```

In the dataset provided by TidyTuesday, there were no awards cancelled in Wyoming or South Dakota. The list includes Puerto Rico and Washington D.C., which is why the total is 50.

**I suspect that blue states were disproportionately affected by these orders. Let's see if that is true.**

```{r message = FALSE}
# Convert table to dataframe
cancelled_awards <- as.data.frame(table(nsf_terminations$org_state))
cancelled_awards <- cancelled_awards |> 
  rename(state = Var1,
         cancelled_awards_cnt = Freq)
head(cancelled_awards)

# Bring in additional data
election <- read_csv("data/election_results.csv")
awards_by_state <- read_csv("data/awards_by_state.csv")

head(election)
head(awards_by_state)
```

```{r}
# Join datasets
df <- left_join(election, awards_by_state, by = "state")
df <- left_join(df, cancelled_awards, by = "state")
df <- df |> 
  select("state_nm.x", "state", "electoral_votes", "winner", "population", "cancelled_awards_cnt", "awards_funded") |> 
  rename("state_nm" = "state_nm.x") |> 
  mutate(cancelled_awards_cnt = replace_na(cancelled_awards_cnt, 0))

#View(df)
```

```{r}
# Calculate % of awards cancelled and the index
df <- df |> 
  mutate(
    defund_rate = round(cancelled_awards_cnt / awards_funded, digits = 4),
    defund_index = round(defund_rate / mean(defund_rate, na.rm = TRUE) * 100, digits = 1))

# Add red/blue flag for winner of each state
df <- df |> 
  mutate(state_color = case_when(
    winner == "Trump" ~ "red",
    winner == "Harris" ~ "blue"),
    defund_flag = ifelse(defund_index >= 100, "Over Index", "Under Index")
  )

# Bring in centroids
state_centroids <- usmapdata::centroid_labels("states")

# Join centroids to df
df <- left_join(df, state_centroids, by = c("state" = "abbr"))

# Create a sf object for mapping purposes
library(sf)
df_sf <- st_as_sf(df)

#View(df)
#View(df_sf)
```

```{r}
# Cross tab of how many states over/under indexed
df |> 
  group_by(state_color, defund_flag) |> 
  summarize(cnt = n(), .groups = "drop")

mean(df$defund_rate)
```

# Plot

```{r}
library(usmap)

# Load Lato font
font_add_google("Lato", "lato")

# Extract the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) for usmap and apply it to the df_sf
usmap_proj <- usmap_crs()

# Convert defund_flag to a factor
df_sf$defund_flag <- factor(df_sf$defund_flag)

# Plot map of U.S.
plot_usmap(
  regions = "states",
  data = df_sf,
  values = "state_color") +

  # Plot the over/under index bubbles by explicitly mapping the 'geom' column to the 'geometry' aesthetic
  geom_sf(data = df_sf,
          aes(geometry = geom, size = defund_flag),
          color = "black",
          alpha = 0.6,
          inherit.aes = FALSE) +

      ) +

    # Plot labels
  labs(title = "Were NSF grants more likely to be terminated in blue states in April 2025?",
       subtitle = "Average grant terminations per state was ~9%, so over index states are those where 9% or \nmore of active NSF grants were defunded.",
       caption = "Chart produced by Steven Villalon for Tidy Tuesday exercise on May 6, 2025") +

  # Finer details
  theme(
    text = element_text(family = "lato"),
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    legend.position = "right",
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0))
```

This is a clean bit of code to get a usmap object and fill the states with a color for future use.

```{r}
# Clean map plot example
library(usmap)
plot_usmap(
  regions = "states",
  data = df,
  values = "state_color") +
  
  # Fill colors for election results
  scale_fill_manual(
    name = "2024 Election Winner",
    values = c("blue" = "#3498db","red" = "#e74c3c"),
    labels = c("Harris", "Trump")) +
    
  # Format election results legend
  theme(
    legend.position = "right",
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0))
```
