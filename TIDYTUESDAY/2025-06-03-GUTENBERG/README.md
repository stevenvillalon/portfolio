# Project Gutenberg

This week we're exploring books from Project Gutenberg and the {[https://docs.ropensci.org/gutenbergr/](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-06-03/gutenbergr)} R package!

> \[{gutenbergr} allows you to\] Download and process public domain works in the Project Gutenberg collection <https://www.gutenberg.org/>. Includes metadata for all Project Gutenberg works, so that they can be searched and retrieved.

-   How many different languages are available in the Project Gutenberg collection? How many books are available in each language?

-   Do any authors appear under more than one `gutenberg_author_id`?

-   How might the {gutenbergr} package authors further refine the data for greater ease-of-use?
