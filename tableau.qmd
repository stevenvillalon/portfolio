## 1. SV Cruises

I recently walked the Camino de Santiago in northern Spain, where I met a fellow pilgrim from Denmark who shared stories about his home and travels through Europe. Ever since, I’ve been dreaming of taking a Scandinavian cruise. For fun, I decided to simulate data for a fictitious cruise company and build an interactive dashboard in Tableau to practice my data visualization skills.

This project involved designing relationships using Tableau’s logical data model, developing calculated fields and Level of Detail (LOD) expressions, and creating dynamic KPIs with contextual breakdowns. Along the way, I tackled common data aggregation challenges and improved my ability to structure metrics clearly for executive-level dashboards.

Hopefully, I’ll get to turn this dream vacation into a reality soon!
